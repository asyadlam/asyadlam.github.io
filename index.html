											<h3>Facebook Clone</h3>
											<h5>December 2022</h5>
											<iframe width="690" height="370" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bP_GY4xx_LY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
											<div class="inner">
												<h4>Project</h4>
												<p>This clone was made in order to help the company SMIP. As a tech consultant,
													I had to develop this clone for the company to test out some of their programs. 
													I had no experience prior to this project regarding React JS.
												</p>
											</div>
											<p>
												<br />
												<b>Tech Stack:</b>
												<br />
												React JS, Javascript, CSS (Following a tutorial)
												<br />
												Building this simplistic clone of Facebook has helped me explore different programming languages.
												I had to use both Front-End as well as Back-End to complete it.
												<br />
												<br />
												<b>Challenges Encountered:</b>
												<br />
												I definitely encountered many challenges; many because of the different updates, as well as when using Firebase, 
												and towards the end when my code just decided not to work anymore. 
												But the updates were crucial as it was hard figuring out what had to be changed accordingly.

											<h3>Resume Website</h3>
											<h5>September 2022 - Present</h5>
											<a href="https://github.com/asyadlam/asyadlam.github.io" target="_blank" class="image"><img src="images/cookiemonster.png" alt="" /></a>
											<div class="inner">
												<h4>Project</h4>
												<p>This website was made with the purpose of showcasing some of my projects as well as sharing my appreciation for the subject. 
													This experience has helped me develop my skills in Front-End.
												</p>
											</div>
											<p>
												<br />
												<b>Tech Stack:</b>
												<br />
												HTML5, CSS, Javascript (Self-taught)
												<br />
												Building this website has helped me learn more about Front-End languages in a fun and creative way. 
												I took a template from html5up.net and modified it accordingly to my liking.
												<br />
												<br />
												<b>Challenges Encountered:</b>
												<br />
												I had a bit of trouble figuring out how to import videos onto the website as github requires payment to do so (large files).
												Instead I used YouTube to screenrecord my projects and directly use the embedded link to the video onto my website.
